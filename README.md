Machine Learning Project - Churn Modelling
Business Objective:
Customer churn is a concerning problem for large companies (especially in the Telecom field) due to its direct effect on the revenues. Companies often seek to know which customers are likely to churn in the near 
future so that a timely action could be taken to prevent it.

Problem Statement:
We had been assigned the task to build a Machine Learning model that predicts which of their customers are likely to churn (stop using their service in future) for this Telecom company. 

Tools Used:
• Python(Jupyter Notebook)
* MS-Excel

Data Description
The dataset provided for this activity consists of 11 features where 10 are independent 
features and 1 is a target variable. Features in this dataset are described as below:
• Churn : 1 if customer cancelled service, 0 if not (Target)
• AccountWeeks : number of weeks customer has had active account
• ContractRenewal : 1 if customer recently renewed contract, 0 if not
• DataPlan : 1 if customer has data plan, 0 if not
• DataUsage : gigabytes of monthly data usage
• CustServCalls : number of calls into customer service
• DayMins : average daytime minutes per month
• DayCalls : average number of daytime calls
• MonthlyCharge : average monthly bill
• OverageFee : largest overage fee in last 12 months
• RoamMins : average number of roaming minutes
